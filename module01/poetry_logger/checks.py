"""Probe a URL, report what happened.

Nothing in this file imports Flask. Health checking is not a web concern — it
is a thing the web layer happens to call — and keeping the two apart is what
lets you reuse this module from a cron job, a test, or a Slack bot later.

Each probe is a plain dict with a fixed set of keys:

    name        the label shown on the board
    url         what was requested
    status      HTTP status code, or None if the request never completed
    latency_ms  round trip in whole milliseconds, or None on failure
    error       exception class name, or None on success
    ok          True when a response came back under 400

Every key is present in every result, including the failure case. A dict whose
shape depends on which branch built it is the thing that turns into a KeyError
three files away.
